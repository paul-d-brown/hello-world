# hello-world
My first re-attempt at using GitHub
I'm a high school computer science teacher, probably became aware of GitHub about 10 years ago, used it briefly, then stopped for a long time. Figure it's about time to reacquaint myself with it.
Been teaching 14 years, spent 22 years at IBM before that in marketing and training departments.
